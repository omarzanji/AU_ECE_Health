\section{Introduction}
Sleep is one of the most important functions in the human body. It is also very predictable and has expected patterns that we can model. Sleep activity can be either quiet, non-rapid eye movement (NREM) or active, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep.

To capture sleep data, high sensitivity accelerometers can be attached to the wrist and other parts of the body during sleep to capture the predictable movements during NREM/REM. This data is referred to as actigraphy. There are existing models that can automatically label actigraphy data, but there is a lack of models that can accurately predict disorders that affect sleep.
